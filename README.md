# Stepi

A new way to plan your large projects.

Break down your project into tasks, and then subtasks. Each subtask can be broken down into more subtasks, until in the end you have a list of doable small-scale tasks, perfect for you to start on.

Your project pipeline can also optionally include time estimations on how long each task will take, giving you an estimate to the length of complex tasks, or even your entire project!


## Features

- Break your project down into infinite amounts of subtasks
- Manage multiple projects
- Print out your project plan to put the work in your hands
- ... or work on it completely digitally as you mark down your completion!


## Roadmap
This project is still in development.
